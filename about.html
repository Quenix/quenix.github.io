<p>In 2012, I started the Systems Analysis and Development course at the IFSP University
in Araraquara, where in the first two months I was able to pass 1st place in an English and
Algorithm test for Scientific Initiation in the development area. After a few months traveling around
Brazil and performing and participating in lectures/talks at events, I applied for a teaching post at
the Microcamp School. There I taught courses in areas of technology such as Web Design,
Maintenance of Micros and Wired Networks, as well as maintaining the computers in the school
and taking care of the proper functioning of the local network.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2014 I applied for an internship opportunity at HP Brazil and I am succeeded.
The internship was really important on my professional development and it was a great first step
in my career. In less than a year I got hired and I started working in a high availability team at
night, which I am part of till nowadays.</p>

<p>In November of 2015, I also applied for a position as a teacher at the Senac Technical School,
where I also work as a teacher of programming and basic computer courses, as well as working
with "Jovem Aprendiz" classes and volunteer projects (for example: classes at "FUNDAÇÃO
CASA" and also assembly of laboratories in charitable institutions).</p>

<p>Certified in ITIL Foundation in 2015, I am currently improving my development skills with my own
projects, developing hotsites as a freelancer and also contributing to open projects from
colleagues.</p>
